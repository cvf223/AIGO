## 🔬 RESEARCH & LEARNING INTEGRATION

### **Opportunity-Based Research Triggers**
```javascript
Research triggers when:
- 3+ consecutive failures → Research success rate improvement
- New opportunity type detected → Research new strategies  
- 30% profit decline → Research profit optimization
- Gas costs spike → Research gas optimization
```
