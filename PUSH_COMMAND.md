# 🚀 Ready to Push!

The large files have been removed. Now run:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
- Username: `cvf223`
- Password: **YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN**

## If you still have issues:

1. Make sure you're using your Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password
2. If you haven't created a token yet:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token (classic) with `repo` scope
   - Copy the token immediately!

## Success! 🎉

Once pushed, your repository will be available at:
https://github.com/cvf223/AIGO_SYNDICAT

The removed files:
- ❌ 179MB deployment package (not needed in repo)
- ❌ 71MB visualization HTML (can be regenerated)

These files are still on your local machine, just not in Git.
