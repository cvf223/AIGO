# AlphaFold Construction Structure Predictor Conversion Plan
#==========================================================

# CONVERSION MAPPING:
# Market Structure → Construction Structure
# DeFi → HOAI (German Construction Standards)
# Arbitrage Patterns → Structural Integrity Patterns
# Cross-chain Opportunities → Multi-Phase Dependencies
# Market State → Project State
# Trading Strategies → Construction Methodologies
# Liquidity Pools → Material Resources
# Price Movements → Cost Dynamics
# Strategy Evolution → Construction Process Optimization

# HOAI PHASE INTEGRATION:
# LP1: Basic Evaluation → Early design structure prediction
# LP2: Preliminary Planning → Conceptual structure analysis  
# LP3: System Planning → Detailed structural modeling
# LP4: Approval Planning → Compliance structure verification
# LP5: Execution Planning → Construction sequence optimization
# LP6: Preparation Execution → Resource allocation prediction
# LP7: Object Monitoring → Real-time structure monitoring  
# LP8: Object Care → Maintenance structure prediction

# ALPHAFOLD CONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS:
# 1. Structural Integrity Prediction (like protein stability)
# 2. Material Interaction Modeling (like molecular bonds)
# 3. Construction Phase Dependencies (like protein assembly)
# 4. Load Distribution Analysis (like force distribution in proteins)
# 5. Risk Pattern Recognition (like misfolding prediction)
# 6. Optimization Sequences (like folding pathways)
