### ✅ SELF-LEARNING CAPABILITIES:

#### The Flywheel Effect:
```
Better Analysis → Better Training Data → Better Models → Better Analysis
```

#### Core Features:
1. **Expert Model**: Uses `deepseek-v3:latest` for top-tier analysis
2. **Average Model**: Uses `mistral:7b` for baseline comparison  
3. **Judge Model**: Uses `qwen2.5:72b` for evaluation
4. **Math Expert**: `phi3:14b` assigned for autoformalization

#### Knowledge Extraction:
- Golden rules automatically identified
- Best practices captured from expert analysis
- Common errors catalogued from average analysis
- Spatial relationships from vision analysis
- HOAI compliance patterns recognized

### ✅ VISION & LABELING STATUS:

#### Zero-Shot Labeling (ZeroShotConstructionLabeler.js):
- **811 lines** of production code
- CLIP-based element detection
- Dynamic vocabulary expansion
- Construction-specific vocabulary
- Confidence calibration

#### Vision Transformers (HierarchicalVisionTransformer.js):
- **1152 lines** of state-of-the-art implementation
- Swin Transformer V2 architecture
- DETR object detection
- SegFormer segmentation
- CrossViT multi-scale attention
- 32-core CPU optimization

### 📊 FINAL ASSESSMENT:

| Component | Status | Lines of Code | Integration |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| SFT Flywheel | ✅ COMPLETE | 1,128 | 100% |
