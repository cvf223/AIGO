Generating advice based on diagnostics...
[ADVICE] General recommendations:
[ADVICE] 1. If agents are not responding, check if the agent runtimes are actually running. The "0 agent runtimes active" message suggests a runtime initialization problem.
[ADVICE] 2. Try running the system with "./run-with-debug.sh" which includes detailed diagnostic logging.
[ADVICE] 3. Check the telegram-bridge.log for any connection problems with the Telegram API.
[ADVICE] 4. Ensure the correct room ID is being used consistently throughout the system.
[ADVICE] 5. If messages are being received in Telegram but not showing in logs, your telegram-logger.js script should be able to detect them by monitoring memory files directly.
[ADVICE] 
Common fixes for "0 agent runtimes active" issue:
[ADVICE] 1. Restart the system with a clean slate: "./run-with-logs.sh"
[ADVICE] 2. If initialization is failing, ensure all required directories exist and have proper permissions.
[ADVICE] 3. Check for valid character files in "agent/data/characters/" - they must be valid JSON.
[ADVICE] 4. Verify the telegram bridge is connecting successfully to your Telegram bot.
[ADVICE] 5. Look for errors in "logs/initialize.log" which may contain useful information.
[ADVICE] 
If agents are working in Telegram but not showing in logs:
[ADVICE] 1. This could indicate a disconnect between the memory system and runtime monitoring.
[ADVICE] 2. Use the telegram-logger.js script to bypass the runtime monitoring and directly read memory files.
[ADVICE] 3. Check for file permission issues that might prevent writing to log files.
