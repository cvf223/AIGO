Risk Adjustment:\n   - Reducing max exposure per strategy from $500K to $350K\n   - Increasing profit thresholds by 0.2% to account for higher slippage risk\n   - Activating additional validation checks before execution\n\n2. Strategy Shifts:\n   - Increasing focus on stable asset pairs (USDC/USDT/DAI) from 30% to 45% of operations\n   - Reducing exposure to high-volatility tokens by 25%\n   - Deploying our specialized volatility arbitrage agent to capitalize on price swings\n\n3. System Optimizations:\n   - Decreasing execution time thresholds by 15% to capture faster-moving opportunities\n   - Increasing real-time monitoring frequency from 5s to 2s intervals\n   - Activating secondary provider connections for redundancy\n\nI've already communicated these changes to all specialized agents. We'll reassess in 4 hours or when volatility metrics return to normal ranges."
