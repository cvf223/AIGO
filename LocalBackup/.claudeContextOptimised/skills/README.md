## How to Use These Skills

1. **Read First**: Start with `production-only-development.md` to understand our core philosophy
2. **Apply Consistently**: Every implementation must follow these patterns
3. **Enhance Continuously**: Use `error-enhancement-protocol.md` to improve
4. **Connect Deeply**: Follow `deep-connection-methodology.md` for integration
5. **Verify Always**: Apply formal verification and compliance checks

## Skill Implementation Checklist

When implementing any feature, ensure:

- [ ] No mocks or simulations (production-only)
- [ ] Connected to 5-7 existing systems (deep-connection)
- [ ] HOAI compliant if construction-related
- [ ] Quantum-inspired optimization applied
- [ ] Error handling enhances the system
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] Security is built-in, not added
- [ ] Performance is optimized for 896GB server

## Contributing New Skills

When adding new skill documentation:

1. Follow the established format
2. Include concrete examples
3. Provide implementation patterns
4. Reference existing code
5. Add to this README
