// Verify input
const verification = await truthVerifier.verifyConceptInput(
    inputData,
    { source: 'user_input' }

if (verification.verified) {
    // Store in knowledge graph
    const personalKG = await sharedKG.getPersonalGraph(agentId);
    const node = await personalKG.createNode(inputData);
    
    // Promote to shared if consensus
    const consensus = await sharedKG.consensusEngine.achieveConsensus(
        node,
